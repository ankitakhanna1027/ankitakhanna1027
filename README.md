# About Me

Hello! My name is Ankita and I am currently a first-year MBA Candidate at the Simon School of Business at the University of Rochester. I am specializing in the Marketing track with the goal of going into Market Research and Market Development Strategy, as I enjoy working with people, learning about their interests, and leveraging those to create inclusive marketing solutions. 

## Background

I was born in Calcutta, India but only lived there for the first year of my life. Because of my father's job, my family would move from country to country quite often, so other than India, I have also lived in Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Nigeria, China, Singapore, the UAE, and the US. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Psychology from New York University and also have close to 3 years of experience working as a Recruitment Consultant at SystemsAccountants Inc, a boutique agency that specializes in recruiting Information Systems professionals.

## Interests

In my spare time, I enjoy drawing and painting illustrations and photography! While I'm not competent on the ice myself, I also am an avid figure skating fan and enjoy watching figure skating competitions and events. One thing on my bucket list is to watch either the ISU World Figure Skating Championships or the Winter Olympics Figure Skating events in person. 

## Fun Facts

* I have an identical twin sister who is 2 minutes older than me! I do sometimes think we are mirror twins (Ex. I'm right-handed and she's left-handed).
* My stomach has a bottomless pit when it comes to desserts, particularly anything to do with dark chocolate! 
* I was terrified of dogs as a child, but now I absolutely adore them! If I had to pick a spirit animal, I would pick a dog.
* This surprises a lot of people because of my petite frame and sometimes girly dress sense, but I love listening to hark rock and heavy metal.
